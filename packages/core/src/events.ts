/**
 * Event orders: a resting order whose trigger is a sentence rather than a price.
 *
 * The OrderBook already holds the arithmetic kind. "Sell if ETH crosses 4000" is
 * a number a feed can answer, so it lives on-chain and the keeper fills it from
 * a Chainlink read. "Sell if a top-five exchange halts withdrawals" is not a
 * number at all, and no feed will ever answer it. Those orders live here: the
 * condition is kept as the person wrote it, the judgment layer rules on it, and
 * a fill runs through the same signed-intent path an autonomous trade uses, so
 * the caps the user granted on-chain enforce themselves without being restated.
 *
 * The part worth reading twice is the screen. A condition the validators cannot
 * source evidence for is not a slow order, it is a broken one: it would rest
 * forever, and any fill it ever produced would be a guess dressed as a verdict.
 * So before an order is armed we spend one round trip asking whether public
 * evidence could settle it at all, and refuse it with a reason the person can
 * read if the answer is no. Refusing early is the honest failure.
