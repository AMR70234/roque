/**
 * The background loops that make Roque live rather than merely responsive.
 * The indexer keeps the trade history current; the keeper watches resting limit
 * orders and fills the ones whose trigger the market has reached. Both are safe
 * to run anywhere: the indexer is idempotent, and the keeper can only ever pay
 * gas to attempt a fill the contract itself judges valid.
 *
 * Two slower loops sit alongside them. Judgment carries the work that has to ask
 * GenLayer something: screening event conditions, then deciding whether they
 * came true, and walking playbooks one rung at a time. Proposals is the agent
 * looking over each active vault and writing down what it would do next.
 *
 * This same module is the entry point for `pnpm keeper`, so the background work
 * can run as its own process on a host that supports long-lived workers, or
 * in-process alongside the API for a single-command local backend.

 * where a pass genuinely can run for minutes, that is the difference between
 * one fill and two. A skipped tick costs nothing: the row is still due next
 * time, because due-ness is a database fact rather than something the loop
 * remembers.
 *
 * Worth being exact about the scope: this stops a loop overlapping *itself* and
 * nothing more. The same work also runs from a Vercel cron and, for the keeper,
 * from a GitHub Action, and no wrapper in this process can see those. The guards
 * that handle two processes are in the database and on the chain: a claim before
 * acting, a lease before paying for a consensus round, and a serialised queue in
 * front of the relayer wallet.
