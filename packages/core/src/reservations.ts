/**
 * Vault money already promised to something.
 *
 * `funding.ts` answers "can the vault pay for this?" by reading the chain. That
 * was the whole story while every trade was signed and settled in one breath,
 * and it stopped being the whole story the moment an order could rest for a
 * fortnight. An event order is a promise to spend days from now, and until that
 * promise was written down it was invisible: the money sat in the vault looking
 * spendable, counted as available to the next order written against it, and
 * could be withdrawn in full while the order meant to spend it was still armed.
 *
 * This module used to be where that promise lived, as a row in a table, and the
 * honest caveat printed at the top was that a row is not a lock. It shut the
 * app's own withdraw button and nothing else. A person could spend the same
 * balance on an ordinary autonomous trade and withdraw what it bought, since the
 * ledger had never heard of the token on the other side. The hold was a note
 * stuck to money anyone could walk past.
 *
 * So the executor owns the hold now. `AgentExecutor.lockedBalance` is the line
 * between the free and committed halves of a vault, withdraw and every agent
 * trade are measured against it, and nothing can route around it because the
 * only function that can move the money is the one doing the checking.
 *
 * What is left here is the story, not the custody. A row records which order
 * promised what, which rung of which plan, and whether the figure came from a
 * percentage somebody typed, so the vault panel can say "committed to 2 live
 * orders" instead of an unexplained number. The figures themselves are read off
 * the chain. When the two disagree the chain is right, by construction.
 *
 * The percentage case is still the awkward one. Its size is decided at fire
 * time against whatever the balance is then, so there is no figure it has
 * committed to in advance. Holding nothing turned out to be useless in exactly
 * the case people reach for first: "spend all of my rUSDC when X happens" held
 * nothing at all, and the vault showed the whole balance as free right up until
 * the order tried to fill. So a share is resolved against what is free at the
 * moment it is promised and that figure is locked, with the percentage kept
 * beside it so the UI can say where the number came from. The fill still sizes
 * itself at fire time. What the hold promises is "this much will still be here",
 * which is the useful guarantee even when the final size is decided later.
