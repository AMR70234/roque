 * A word on trust, because it is the whole point of splitting the system this
 * way: nothing GenLayer returns can move money. Its answer is a suggestion. The
 * relayer turns a valid suggestion into a signed intent and submits it to
 * Sepolia, where the real dollar caps live and the actual tokens sit. So a wrong
