/**
 * Can the vault actually pay for this?
 *
 * Every unattended trade Roque makes — an event order that fires, a playbook
 * rung that comes due — spends from `AgentExecutor.vaultBalance[user][token]`
 * and from nowhere else. The connected wallet is not touched, because the agent
 * has no authority over it. That is a good property right up until someone
 * writes an order against money the agent cannot reach, at which point the
 * order is not resting, it is broken: it arms, it waits, the condition comes
 * true, and the fill fails on a balance check the person was never shown.
 *
 * `preflightVaultSwap` already refuses that fill. This module moves the same
 * refusal forward to the moment the person signs, which is the only moment they
 * can do anything about it. The rule is deliberately the narrow one the user
 * asked for: enough for *that* trade, judged per leg, not a portfolio model.
 *
 * What the balance means is the subtle part. A vault balance is not the same as
 * spendable money once orders can rest for a fortnight: an armed event order has
 * already promised part of it. So the figure this gate compares against is the
 * balance minus what the executor is holding for commitments, which is what
 * stops one deposit from backing two orders that each believe they can spend it.
 *
 * That subtraction used to be a sum over a table, and the table was advisory.
 * It is `AgentExecutor.lockedBalance` now, which is the same number the contract
 * will refuse a withdrawal or an unrelated trade against. So this gate and the
 * on-chain refusal cannot drift apart: being short here means being short there.
 *
 * The arithmetic is pure and the chain read is one thin wrapper over it, so the
 * interesting part — which legs the vault is even on the hook for — is testable
 * without a node.
